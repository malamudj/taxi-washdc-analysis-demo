# Washington DC Taxi Exploratory Analysis
This project provides a workflow to complete an exploratory data analysis of Washington DC taxi data that is publicly available from Open Data DC. Three different notebooks are provided that focus on reading and inspecting data, plotting visualizations, and mapping geospatial data. <br><br> As an analyst with the Washington DC Department of For-hire Vehicles (DFHV), I wanted to share tools that can quickly identify industry trends and provide insights about the taxi industry. 


## Project Details:

**Language used:** Python

The first notebook uses the Pandas library to read in 12 months of taxi data from the downloaded zip file and consolidate the dataframes into one.
