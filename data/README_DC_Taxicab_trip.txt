ORIGINATOR: Department of For-Hire Vehicles (DFHV)

PROCESS DESCRIPTION: DFHV provided OCTO with a taxicab trip text file representing trips.  OCTO processed the data to assign a block locations to pick up and drop off locations.  The blocks were assigned using the original pick up, drop off lat/long coordinates and searching for the block locations in the DC Master Address Repository (radius tolerance of 250 meters and less).  The pick and drop off times were also rounded to the nearest hour.

In addition, the pick up and drop off locations were assigned to an airport using locator polygons for Reagan, BWI, and Dulles.  These polygons generally followed the visual borders of these airports.
